trying to fix routes, change underscore to dash in auth

Patterns to consider: keep test routes to minimal, no redirect, no flash message

Changed log file backup to 0, Adds 'Roff' to repo languages

1. Admin blueprint - Admin panel:
features to implement:
custom model for admins
custom views for admins
custom model views for admins
custom login_required decorator for admins
custom forms for admins

Now where to start? A new model or initializing the flask-admin package?

We can choose to either extend the current user model to have an is_admin field, or implement separate admin model.
I will make a separate model for admins.
Problem: if to make a separate model for admins, the user loader function from flask-login will have issues.
There is also the base class 'Person' approach than user and admin model can derive from later.

For now, i'll just go along with the flask cookbook and use already defined user model.

Added admin boolean field and is_admin method to user model. A database migration is required.
Forgot to add default field. should i delete the migration file or just go with it. I'm deleting it. Better to be specific about everything.

apparently the flask cookbook is implementing admin panel without the flask-admin extention, at first try.

VERY IMPORTANT:
the reason that no error would be showed if csrf_token was missing, is that 'if form.errors' was not added to the end of route. From now on this will be a permanent pattern for me.
