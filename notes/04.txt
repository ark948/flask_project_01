1. Change of plans. Out of flask's official docs, Flask cookbook, and miguel's tutorial, cookbook and miguel have chosen unittest for testing. (My mistake, they can be used together.)
2. Let's switch to from pytest to unittest.
3. Entire concept of testing requires more research.
UNKNOWN ERROR
4. Came back to test registration again, apparently database changes are not commited. THE ENTIRE USER TABLE DOES NOT EXIST!
Need to find out what is causing the problem, Database connection seemds fine. alembic_version table exists, but no user table.
5. There is something wrong with migration. Somehow the only migration that exists is the head.
According to my notes, i did ran migration and upgrade command.
Let's try to run the migration and upgrade again, see if changes remain.
Maybe the problem was caused because i repeatedly opened pgadmin4 to check if my changes took effect, with the same user.
Tested again. Works fine. Now need to make sure database changes have takne effect. But how?
Let's check if revision file was pushed into repository. Only the base revision exists.
Let's commit one now.
