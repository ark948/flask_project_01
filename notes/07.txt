Before implementing email verification and password reset, i fixed a small problem.

When the inner app folder was named 'app', some context shell variables would not work, like sa and so.
(flask_shop_vscode > app - run.py)

This was fixed by changing the inner app folder to source.
(flask_shop_vscode > source - run.py)
and adding .env file and loading it in config.py file.
Now shell context works perfectly.
