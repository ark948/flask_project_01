1. flask-sqlalchemy and flask-migrate packages must be installed.
venv> pip install flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate psycopg2

2. Need to initialize flask-sqlalchemy for postgresql
3. Logged in to postgresql shell (psql) cmd> psql -U postgres, enter password...
4. Created a new database called shop, cmd> create database shop; \l to list the databases

5. Now we need to connect to this database in flask. Also added 'basedir' var to config file. seems useful.

6. Add sqlalchemy_database_uri to config
7. Initialize db of flask-sqlalchemy and migrate object of flask-migrate in init file.
8. Create a model
9. Run database initialization venv> flask db init
10. 'migrations' folder must now appear next to app folder.
11. Import models in env.py file of the migration folder.
12. Run flask db migrate -m "message" and flask db upgrade.

13. Time to add auth blueprint. Add auth folder, init file, routes file.
14. Do not forget to add url_prefix when registering auth blueprint in main init file.
15. Next step will be adding flask-login and flask-form. Forgot to commit.
