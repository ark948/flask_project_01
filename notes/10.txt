We'll start by customizing the textareafield widget from wtforms. Also reading the docs seems like a good idea.

Also, i'm going to add if form.errors to login and register.

Note: while reading wtforms, found out that custom filters can also be added to fields (to_persian)

i was looking at the wrong section in wtforms doc (custom fields).
i should have been looking at custom widgets

Before that, i will try to render ckeditor without python, just with html forms.
for some reason the ckeditor nor the bootstrap file can be found.
I successfully narrowed down the cause of the problem. The location of the ckeditor js file is problematic. it cannot be found
because the online one works fine.
Fixed the problem by adding static url path to app.
Now all that is left is to successfully load the ckeditor using pyton code and not the html.

I give up. I can't do this now. I'm going to use flask-ckeditor and then do more study on this later.
the notes field on user works fine.

Ok, after hours of struggle, i was finally able to use flask-ckeditor. 
very important note: must download version ckeditor version 4 and standard version.
I don't know why yet, but version 5 or any lts version will not work.

Time to implement one the main functionalities, either the blog or shop. let's go with shop.
nevermind that, the site looks terrible, i'll try to add flask-bootstrap.
