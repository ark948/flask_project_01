1. Create project folder structure, create virtual environment, create empty git repository. Add .gitignore file immediately.

IMPORTANT: Explicitly add .gitignore file to git by using: git add .gitignore

2. gitignore summary:
    include:
    source folder
    notes folder

    exclude:
    venv folder
    .idea folder

3. Create the config file. The application factory. Test route.
4. Install flask using: pip install flask. Add requirements.txt: pip freeze > requirements.txt
5. Instantiate flask app from application factory in run.py. and run the server to check. If successful, commit.
6. Test if config file was accurately imported by printing adding a random value to config and print in application factory.

IMPORTANT STEP
7. Add the first test. (using pytest for now...) works fine.

8. Add main blueprint
9. Restructured the project. brought content of source outside and removed source.

10. Changed main language to Farsi.
