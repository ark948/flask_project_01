Database problem still exists.
It came back for some reason.
I will drop all databases i created, and will follow digitalocean postgresql and flask tutorial to create a new user and database.

Alright, seems ok. again. Honestly i have no idea what happened. Maybe because added 'psycopg2 to connection string.
But still not sure.
Anyway...about testing. I have came to conclusion that captcha are made for human eye and are made to be automated.
So i have to disable them for testing. I'll try in config file.
