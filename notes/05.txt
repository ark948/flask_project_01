Database problem still exists.
It came back for some reason.
I will drop all databases i created, and will follow digitalocean postgresql and flask tutorial to create a new user and database.

Alright, seems ok. again. Honestly i have no idea what happened. Maybe because added 'psycopg2 to connection string.

Testing was ok.

1. Added error handlers. Not in a blueprint, just a file.
2. Features left, are admin, verification recovery (user), email and logging, ticket system, shop and blog.
email verification and password recovery depend on email system so it must be implemented. Email system itself depends on logging.
Let's add logging and then email system.
