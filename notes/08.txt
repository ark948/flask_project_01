New idea about feature to implement: username availability check (from client without submitting Ajax stuff)

Also do something about aiosmtpd server, some sort of a cli shortcut

Implementing email verification,
For that profile page is required.

Implementing profile page:
1. Add a route to auth
2. Add just display user information
3. Add a link to confirm the email to which verification token will be sent
4. Upon submitting that form, we will pass that user object to email.py.
5. email.py will use that user object to generate a token. (a method of uesr model)
6. email.py will use its send_email function to send a email containing that token to user's email.
7. for email to be displayed, two template files must be created in templates/email folder, containing a link with token.
one txt and one html.
8. Those two templates will send a request (along with the token) to verify_token route.
9. That route will get the token from url, and uses the verify classmethod of User class to check if it is valid.
10. If it was valid, it will simply get the user from database and change its 'is_verified' and 'verified_on' columns accordingly.
